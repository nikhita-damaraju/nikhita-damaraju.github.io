* I'm a second year M.S. candidate at the department of Biostatistics concentrating in Statistical Genetics at Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health. 
* My research interest is at the intersection of public health and functional genomics using advanced computational methods. In the future, I hope to contribute to the field of precision medicine.
* Prior to this, I completed a dual degree (B.S.-M.S.) in Biological Sciences at the Indian Institute of Technology focused in Computational Biology.
* When I'm not busy with my coursework, I enjoy playing the violin, photography, running and inventing new desserts!
