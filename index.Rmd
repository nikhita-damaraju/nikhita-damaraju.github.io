* I am a second year PhD Student at the University of Washington’s <a href = "https://iphg.biostat.washington.edu/"> Institute for Public Health Genetics </a> jointly advised by <a href = "https://dlmp.uw.edu/faculty/miller"> Dr. Danny Miller </a> and <a href = "https://dlmp.uw.edu/faculty/shirts"> Dr. Brian Shirts </a>. My research is focused on optimizing long-read sequencing data for clinical care and population genetics.

* My research experiences broadly cover the fields of Genomics, Public Health and Statistics. I'm passionate about improving the field of translational research. 

* Prior to this I graduated with a M.S. in Biostatistics concentrating in Statistical Genetics at <a href = "https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/"> Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health </a> and a integrated B.S.-M.S. in Biological Sciences focused in Computational Biology at the <a href = "https://www.iitm.ac.in/"> Indian Institute of Technology Madras </a>.

* When I'm not busy with my research, I enjoy hiking, kayaking, archery and playing the violin!
