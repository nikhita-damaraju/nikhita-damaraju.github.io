I am a second year PhD Student at the University of Washington's [Institute for Public Health Genetics](https://iphg.biostat.washington.edu/) jointly advised by [Dr. Danny Miller](https://dlmp.uw.edu/faculty/miller) and [Dr. Brian Shirts](https://dlmp.uw.edu/faculty/shirts). My research is focused on optimizing long-read sequencing data for clinical care and population genetics.

When I'm not busy with my research, I enjoy hiking, kayaking, archery and playing the violin!
