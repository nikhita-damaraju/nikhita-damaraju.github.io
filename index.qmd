I am a third-year PhD student at the University of Washington's [Institute for Public Health Genetics](https://iphg.biostat.washington.edu/), working in the [Miller lab](https://millerlaboratory.com/). My research interests lie at the intersection of bioinformatics, statistical genetics, and health economics, with a focus on advancing translational research. My dissertation centers on evaluating long-read sequencing for clinical care and developing applications that leverage this technology to improve patient outcomes.

Throughout my academic journey, I\'ve engaged in diverse projects that bridge disciplines like statistics, genetics, cancer biology, biochemistry, machine learning, and public health. I am passionate about using these interdisciplinary skills to drive innovations in precision medicine.

Beyond research, I enjoy hiking, kayaking, practicing archery, and playing the violin.
