    "text": "It has been observed that the public does not have a clear purview of the research and findings in biotechnology, so much so that a basic know-how of genetics is also not common and the brunt of the decisions in public domain falls into the hands of lobbyists for example, GMOs.\nAs a part of the iGEM 2018 competition’s human practices and community outreach component, our team worked on making and spreading content about the basics of biotech in a commoner’s language. The content is now available in 26 Indian and international languages like Kannada, Tamil, Telugu, Marathi, Hindi, Bengali, Malayalam, Gujarati, Assamese, French, Mandarin, Malay, Spanish, Bosnian, Arabic, Catalan and Chinese and English on the YouTube channel for viewing.\nThis initiative continues to be an important outreach component of team IIT Madras’ iGEM participation till date. Our work was covered by Indian newspapers like Times of India and New Indian Express along with newsltters like IEEE India Council (Sep 2018 issue) and India Bioscience.\n\n\n\nTeam members of iGEM IIT Madras 2018 along with instructors and mentors."

    "text": "This project was done as a part of GH 539: Analyzing Qualitative Data in Winter 2024 at University of Washington.\n\nMotivation\nAccording to the Orphan Drug Act, fewer than 200,000 people in the United States suffer from a rare disease, and about 400 million people worldwide face rare diseases. The complexity comes from the fact that 95% of these conditions have no FDA-approved treatment and 65% are associated with reduced life expectancy and quality of life. The frequency of rare diseases, especially genetic diseases, in children under 5 years old is increasing every year. Seeking a diagnosis can be emotionally and financially taxing, with the added risk of getting a misdiagnosis of common conditions. \nSocial media plays a vital role in providing a wider reach and connecting parents facing these challenges and provides a platform of support. An active rare disease community on social media offers a unique opportunity for research that provides insights that help understand these diseases and enable treatment options. The utilization of social media platforms, particularly Facebook and Instagram, by parents of children with rare genetic disorders is a phenomenon that has received attention in existing literature. Specifically in situations where offline support groups for specific rare disorders are unavailable, social media serves as an important tool that offers a sense of community, understanding, and sharing experiences.\n\n\nAims\n\nIdentifying patterns and trends in social media engagement among parents and caregivers,\nExploring implications of social media usage in different aspects of pediatric rare genetic disorders such as diagnosis, treatment, health insurance, etc.\n\n\n\nMethods\n\nCodebook development to analyze data from published news articles of caregivers and research studies.\nIdentifying social science theoretical frameworks suitable for analyzing the aims of the project.\nThematic analysis to identify key patterns to answer the question of interest."
