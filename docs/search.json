The content is now available in 26 Indian and international languages like Kannada, Tamil, Telugu, Marathi, Hindi, Bengali, Malayalam, Gujarati, Assamese, French, Mandarin, Malay, Spanish, Bosnian, Arabic, Catalan and Chinese and English on the YouTube channel for viewing.\nThis initiative continues to be an important outreach component of team IIT Madras’ iGEM participation till date.

    "text": "This project done as a part of HEOR 500 Intro to Pharmacoeconomics course in Spring 2023 at University of Washington.\n\nOverview\nDuchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a X-linked degenerative neuromuscular diseases caused by a gene mutation in the DMD region of the X chromosome. The phenotype results in the loss of expression of dystrophin, a protein required to preserve muscle integrity during contraction. DMD is a rare genetic disorder that currently affects over 10000 males in the United States. Symptoms start before birth and progress to delayed developmental milestones eventually resulting premature death due to complications such as respiratory insufficiency and cardiomyopathy. There is currently no cure for DMD and standard of care (SoC) includes but is not limited to, corticosteroid use in the early years leading to multidisciplinary management options to preserve ambulatory function.\nRecently, investigational gene therapies such as SRP-9001 have been granted a Fast Track FDA status for the treatment of DMD intending to be a single intravenous-based treatment strategy. In order to increase the inclusion in insurance coverage policies, I evaluated a study that aims to conduct a comprehensive CEA that comparatively evaluates the relative costs of SPR-9001 plus SoC vs standalone SoC from the perspective of a US healthcare payer."

In order to navigate these challenges, it is important to have access to comprehensive insurance coverage that includes genetic testing and treatment. However, insurance coverage for genetic-related issues can often be complex and difficult to understand. While there are some state laws in place that offer additional protections against genetic discrimination in insurance coverage for those with rare genetic diseases, the federal exemption under the Genetic Information Non-discrimination Act (GINA) can still create uncertainty. In light of these complexities, it is important to explore the various state-level protections against genetic discrimination to fully understand the landscape of genetic discrimination in the US. By doing so, individuals can make informed decisions about disclosing genetic information for IVF while minimizing his risk of discrimination from insurers."

An active rare disease community on social media offers a unique opportunity for research that provides insights that help understand these diseases and enable treatment options. The utilization of social media platforms, particularly Facebook and Instagram, by parents of children with rare genetic disorders is a phenomenon that has received attention in existing literature. Specifically in situations where offline support groups for specific rare disorders are unavailable, social media serves as an important tool that offers a sense of community, understanding, and sharing experiences.\n\n\nAims\n\nIdentifying patterns and trends in social media engagement among parents and caregivers,\nExploring implications of social media usage in different aspects of pediatric rare genetic disorders such as diagnosis, treatment, health insurance, etc.\n\n\n\nMethods\n\nCodebook development to analyze data from published news articles of caregivers and research studies.\nIdentifying social science theoretical frameworks suitable for analyzing the aims of the project.\nThematic analysis to identify key patterns to answer the question of interest."

    "text": "This presentation was a part of BIME 597 seminar in Spring 2023 at University of Washington.\n\nBackground\nXAI aims to bridge the gap between the complexity of AI algorithms and our ability to interpret and trust their decisions. It seeks to provide explanations for AI outputs, allowing one to understand the underlying logic, factors, or features that influenced those decisions. By providing explanations, XAI came into the picture to \"empower\" people to make informed judgments about the credibility and fairness of AI systems. So, essentially, in some way, it's a subset of AI. It can help in identifying potential biases, detect errors, and ensure that AI models are accountable and align with ethical standards. It can enable experts in various fields, such as healthcare to collaborate with AI systems effectively.\nHowever, it’s important to note that implementing XAI is not without its challenges. Striking the right balance between transparency, accuracy, and privacy can be complex. Different models and techniques for XAI come with their own trade-offs, and finding the most suitable approach for each application requires careful consideration.\nIn this presentation, I summarized the motivations behind XAI, the methods and techniques used to achieve explainability, and the potential benefits and limitations of adopting XAI in various domains.\nSlides - XAI for clinical applications: present and future"
