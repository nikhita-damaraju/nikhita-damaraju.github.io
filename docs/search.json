    "text": "It has been observed that the public does not have a clear purview of the research and findings in biotechnology, so much so that a basic know-how of genetics is also not common and the brunt of the decisions in public domain falls into the hands of lobbyists for example, GMOs.\nAs a part of the iGEM 2018 competition’s human practices and community outreach component, our team worked on making and spreading content about the basics of biotech in a commoner’s language. The content is now available in 26 Indian and international languages like Kannada, Tamil, Telugu, Marathi, Hindi, Bengali, Malayalam, Gujarati, Assamese, French, Mandarin, Malay, Spanish, Bosnian, Arabic, Catalan and Chinese and English on the YouTube channel for viewing.\nThis initiative continues to be an important outreach component of team IIT Madras’ iGEM participation till date. Our work was covered by Indian newspapers like Times of India and New Indian Express along with newsltters like IEEE India Council (Sep 2018 issue) and India Bioscience.\n\n\n\nTeam members of iGEM IIT Madras 2018 along with instructors and mentors."

    "text": "Using long-read sequencing data from the 1000 Genomes Project can improve our understanding of normal patterns of human variation. The impact of using long-reads, particularly in difficult-to-detect regions of the genome can be immense clinically. As more samples are sequenced, this dataset can be used as a variant prioritization set for the development of different types of clinical applications.\nOur work was featured in Genome Web and the Brotman Baty Institute’s newsletter.\nhttps://t.co/3r7DlPRPc3— Quarto (@quarto_pub) February 26, 2024 \nI’m grateful to Dr. Danny Miller for the opportunity to work on this collaborative project as a part of my dissertation work at University of Washington."

My research interests lie at the intersection of bioinformatics, statistical genetics, and health economics, with a focus on advancing translational research. My dissertation centers on evaluating long-read sequencing for clinical care and developing applications that leverage this technology to improve patient outcomes.\nThroughout my academic journey, I’ve engaged in diverse projects that bridge disciplines like statistics, genetics, cancer biology, biochemistry, machine learning, and public health. I am passionate about using these interdisciplinary skills to drive innovations in precision medicine.\nBeyond research, I enjoy hiking, kayaking, and playing the violin."
