Using long-read sequencing data from the 1000 Genomes Project can improve our understanding of normal patterns of human variation. The impact of using long-reads, particularly in difficult-to-detect regions of the genome can be immense clinically. As more samples are sequenced, this dataset can be used as a variant prioritization set for the development of different types of clinical applications.

Our work was featured in [Genome Web](https://www.genomeweb.com/sequencing/long-read-nanopore-sequencing-boosts-structural-variant-analysis-1000-genomes-project?_ga=2.59259883.751286353.1715586008-1330811547.1715586008&adobe_mc=MCMID%3D34839719069782675350042939182093841809%7CMCORGID%3D138FFF2554E6E7220A4C98C6%2540AdobeOrg%7CTS%3D1715586017&CSAuthResp=1%3A%3A2718390%3A1911%3A24%3Asuccess%3ABD95489E51E33D97E8EE3E03941CA6FD) and the [Brotman Baty Institute's newsletter](https://brotmanbaty.org/news/long-read-sequencing-consortium-offers-phd-students-a-role-in-addressing).

I'm grateful to Dr. Danny Miller for the opportunity to work on this collaborative project as a part of my dissertation work at University of Washington.
