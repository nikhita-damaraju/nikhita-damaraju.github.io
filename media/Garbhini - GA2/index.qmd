Many women in lower and middle income countries (LMICs) seek antenatal care for the first time after their first trimester. Developing population-specific dating models has been shown to have better outcomes specifically among those with a higher risk of preterm birth. Read our published research study in [The Lancet Regional Health Southeast Asia](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lansea/article/PIIS2772-3682(24)00012-X/fulltext).

Our work was featured in over 100 regional and national media outlets including [The Economic Times](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/science/garbhini-ga2-iit-madras-thsti-develop-india-specific-ai-gestation-age-estimation-model/articleshow/108006161.cms?from=mdr), [Times of India](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/iit-madras-thsti-faridabad-researchers-develop-the-first-india-specific-ai-model-to-determine-the-age-of-the-foetus/articleshow/108020579.cms), [The Hindu](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/india-specific-model-to-give-accurate-gestational-age-of-foetus/article67888396.ece), [The New Indian Express](https://www.newindianexpress.com/xplore/2024/Mar/01/garbhini-ga2-could-reduce-birth-risk), [Business Today](https://www.businesstoday.in/industry/pharma/story/indian-researchers-pioneer-accurate-pregnancy-dating-model-for-second-and-third-trimesters-419011-2024-02-26), [The Deccan Herald](https://www.deccanherald.com/science/iit-madras-researchers-develop-first-india-specific-ai-model-to-determine-age-of-foetus-2910363) and [Hindustan Times](https://www.hindustantimes.com/education/news/boost-to-pregnancy-care-iit-madras-thsti-develop-ai-powered-model-to-determine-foetus-age-in-pregnant-indian-women-101708938715379.html).

I'm grateful to Dr. Himanshu Sinha for his mentorship and the opportunity to work on this collaborative project during my time as a dual degree student at Indian Institute of Technology, Madras alongside many wonderful people! I'd also like to thank members of the Translational Health Sciences Institute Fairdabad for their support and guidance throughout each step.
