Pushing the boundaries of fast electron spectroscopy, energy-monochromated and aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopes have opened the far infrared to nanometer scale spatial mapping. Together with experiment, we leverage these advances to resolve open fundamental questions in nano-spectroscopy, perform entirely new materials characterization techniques at the single-particle level, and discover advanced materials endowed with unprecedented functionalities.
