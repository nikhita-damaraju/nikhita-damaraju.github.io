# Research Projects
## Inflammatix inc.

## Irving Cancer Center 

## Dual Degree Thesis
Robert Bosch Center for Data Science and AI
<br> July, 2019 – May, 2020
<br> Thesis advisor: Dr. Himanshu Sinha	

*	Assessed multiple gestational age (GA) estimation models on preterm birth prediction for a cohort of North-Indian women.
*	Implemented feature selection and designed a regression-based model for first trimester GA estimation that has the highest preterm birth labelling accuracy [1].
*	Designed a random forest-based model using ultrasound metrics to predict GA accurately in second and third trimesters.
*	Worked in close collaboration with a team of clinicians at the Translational Health Sciences Institute, Delhi as a part of Bill and Melinda Gates foundation grant, Grand Challenges of India grant and BIRAC grant.
*	Presented research at multiple Data Science and AI academic conferences.

## Stanford University CA
Summer Intern, Department of Biochemistry	
May – August, 2019
<br>Advisor: Dr. Julia Salzman

*	Designed a pipeline from scratch that implements generalized linear modelling on transcriptomic data to identify conserved features of genomic repeats that facilitate alternative splicing in primates. 
*	Correlated genomic and transcriptomic data to identify genomic repeat-based features conserved across primate families.
*	Identified several conserved SINE and LINE repeat-based features that facilitate the formation of alternately spliced transcripts.
*	Analyzed the statistical significance of the presence of conserved genomic signatures across the genome.

### Khorana summer fellowship, Stanford University CA
May – August, 2018
<br>Advisor: Dr. Julia Salzman

*	Selected as one of the 40 Khorana fellowship grant recipients among 1000 applicants, 2018 to conduct research at Stanford School of Medicine. 
*	Designed a bioinformatic pipeline for downstream analysis of Epstein Barr virus infected human B-cell transcriptomic datasets downloaded from SRA for lytic and latent infection stages of the virus.
*	Characterized the presence of circRNAs and alternative splicing present in LMP-2A and LMP-2B genes in Epstein-Barr virus validating previous experimental results.
*	Summarized research in the form a detailed report to be presented at the department research seminar.
